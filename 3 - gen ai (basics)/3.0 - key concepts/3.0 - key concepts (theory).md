## Overview
Azure OpenAI provides endpoints to various base and fine-tuned models. These models can be deployed with specific configurations to cater to different needs. The deployments come with distinct settings, which include content moderation, version handling, and deployment size.


## Deployments
Deployments give you access to the Azure OpenAI models. They can be managed by viewing the list, editing existing deployments, or creating new ones.

## Key Concepts:

**Deployment Name:** This is the unique identifier for the deployment. You would use this name to access the deployment.

**Model Name:** This represents the specific model being used in the deployment.

**Version:** This denotes the version of the model being used.

**Type:** Represents the nature of the deployment. In the given context, it seems all deployments are of the 'Standard' type.

**Default TPM:** TPM or Transactions Per Minute. This specifies the maximum number of transactions that can be processed by the deployment in one minute. It's a measure of the deployment's capacity and performance.
