    "| Variable Name     | Description | \n",
    "|--------------------|-------------| \n",
    "| `ENDPOINT`        | Can be located in the *Keys & Endpoint* section when examining your resource from the Azure portal. Also found in Azure OpenAI Studio > Playground > Code View. | \n",
    "| `API-KEY`         | Available in the *Keys & Endpoint* section of the Azure portal. You can choose either `KEY1` or `KEY2`. | \n",

    "**Note:** Visit your resource on the Azure portal. The Endpoint and Keys can be spotted in the *Resource Management* section. Duplicate your endpoint and access key as you'll necessitate both for verifying your API calls. Using either `KEY1` or `KEY2` is acceptable.

    "• Environment variables are crucial for managing configuration settings and parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "• They provide a standardized way to store and access information like API keys, database credentials, and system paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Environment variables enhance security by keeping sensitive information separate from the application code.\n",
    "\n",
    "• They enable easy configuration changes without modifying the source code, simplifying maintenance and updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Environment variables facilitate portability, allowing applications to run seamlessly across different environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Environment variables assist in the separation of concerns, ensuring that application logic is decoupled from configuration details.\n",
