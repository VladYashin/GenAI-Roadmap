# Definition

**Summarization** is the process of shortening a text document or dataset into a concise version that retains the most important information. This can be useful for quickly understanding the content of longer documents, or for generating summaries of large datasets for easier consumption. There are two main approaches to summarization: 

• Extractive 

• Abstractive

There are also other types of summarizations such as **single-document**, **multi-document**, **query-based**, etc.

In the following we'll be focusing only on extractive & abstractive summarization types.


# Extractive Summarization

**Extractive summarization** involves selecting whole sentences or phrases directly from the source document to form the summary. This method essentially "extracts" the most relevant parts of the original content without altering the wording. The challenge here is to identify which sentences or parts are the most informative and relevant to the main idea of the document.


# Abstractive Summariazation

**Abstractive summarization**, on the other hand, involves generating new sentences that convey the main information from the original document. Instead of just copying parts of the source content, abstractive methods aim to understand the content and then "rephrase" or "rewrite" it in a more condensed form. This approach can lead to more natural-sounding summaries but requires more advanced natural language processing capabilities.

# Use Cases

Summarization is often used in various applications & industries to condense & extract meaningful information from large volumes of text. Below I handpicked the most common use cases & summarization types:
